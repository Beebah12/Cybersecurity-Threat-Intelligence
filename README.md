# Introduction : Project Overview
## Title:Global Cybersecurity Threats Analysis (2015–2024)
This is a power BI project on threat analysis sourced from **Kaggle**.
The project is to analyze and derive insights to answer crucial questions and help mitigate future occurrence and enhance data driven decisions.
Between 2015 and 2024, a total of 3,000 cybersecurity attacks were recorded across 10 countries, resulting in $151 billion in financial losses and affecting 2 billion users. The average time to resolve an incident was 36 hours, with the United Kingdom, Germany, and Brazil emerging as the most heavily impacted nations.
Dataset: Contains cyberattack records across countries, industries, and attack types, including fields like:
•	Year, Country, Industry, Attack Type,
•	Financial Loss ($M), Users Affected, Resolution Time, Vulnerability Type

# Problem Statement
